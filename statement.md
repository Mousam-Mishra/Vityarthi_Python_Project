4. Respond to input prompts to receive predictions

## Input Parameters
- Current battery percentage
- Hours since last full charge
- Battery capacity in mAh
- Charger watt rating
- Device type selection (Mobile / Laptop)

## Example Output
Estimated usage time remaining: 5.20 hours  
Battery Health: 82.34%  
Charging Time Required: 1.45 hours  
Status: Low for Laptop – Plug in charger soon

## Testing
- Tested across different battery percentages (10%–90%)
- Tested with charger wattages (10W–120W)
- Tested separately for Mobile and Laptop
- Performed boundary and comparison testing

## Challenges Faced
- Achieving realistic battery health calculation
- Optimizing formula accuracy based on real usage
- Designing simple but effective input structure

## Future Enhancements
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Automated device hardware detection
- Mobile application version
- Historical analytics and graph reports

## Project Documentation
Screenshots, project report PDF and flow diagrams are included separately in the documentation section.
